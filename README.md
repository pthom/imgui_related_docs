## Manuals and documentation for Dear ImGui and related projects I maintain

### Browsable versions

* [Hello ImGui Manual](https://pthom.github.io/hello_imgui/): Hello ImGui is a library designed to make multiplatform app development as simple as writing a "Hello World" program, built on top of Dear ImGui.
* [ImGui Bundle Manual](https://pthom.github.io/imgui_bundle/): an extensive set of ready-to-use widgets and libraries, based on ImGui. Start your first app in 5 lines of code, or less. Whether you prefer Python or C++, this pack has your back.
* [Fiatlight manual](https://pthom.github.io/fiatlight_doc/): Fiatlight automates UI generation for functions and structured data, making prototyping and fine-tuning faster and easier. Fiatlight bridges the gap between code and UI, allowing you to turn ideas into fully functional applications in minutes.
* [Litgen manual](https://pthom.github.io/litgen): litgen , also known as Literate Generator, is an automatic python bindings generator for humans who like nice code and APIs. It can be used to bind C++ libraries into documented and discoverable python modules using pybind11 or nanobind.
